Aim: Disrupt the transition from C-RAF monomer to dimer by stabilizing C-RAF closed intereaction with 14-3-3 dimer. 
Optimize molecular glues to stabilize covalent bonds between 14-3-3 and C-RAF259 as well as polar interaction with CRAF260 residue.
Assays: FP, nanoBRET assays blocking C-RAF NRAS formation. 
MS assay between nucleophile (Cysteine38 on 14-3-3) and electrophile - look at % bound +/- C-RAF259 peptide. 

Selectivity assessed by SPR
14-3-3 is considered to recognize between 2 and 20 amino
acid residues on the client.  Up to this point, to establish the
SAR for C-RAF we used an 11-mer acetylated peptide for the
MS assay and a 10-mer FAM-labeled peptide for the FA as-
say. For a better comparison with crystallography, we
tested the compounds again using 15-mer C-RAF peptides,
before comparing them to A-RAF and B-RAF peptides.

14-3-3σ, tagged with a Twinstrep-tag, was im-
mobilized on a Strep-Tactin XT coated SPR chip. Subse-
quently, a 2-fold dilution series of acetylated 12-mer C-RAF,
A-RAF, and B-RAF peptides were injected. 

14-3-3 interaction with C-RAF peptides ~ uM range Kd. 
14-3-3 + MG interaction with C-RAF peptides ~ nM range Kd.
