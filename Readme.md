Aim: Disrupt the transition from C-RAF monomer to dimer by stabilizing C-RAF closed intereaction with 14-3-3 dimer. 
Optimize molecular glues to stabilize covalent bonds between 14-3-3 and C-RAF259 as well as polar interaction with CRAF260 residue.
Assays: FP, nanoBRET assays blocking C-RAF N-RAS formation. MS assay between nucleophile (Cysteine38 on 14-3-3) and electrophile - look at % bound +/- C-RAF259 peptide.

FP assay with FAM labeled C-RAF259 peptide + 14-3-3sigma +/- MG

SPR: 
Selectivity assessed by SPR 14-3-3 is considered to recognize between 2 and 20 amino acid residues on the client.  Up to this point, to establish the SAR for C-RAF we used an 11-mer acetylated peptide for the MS assay and a 10-mer FAM-labeled peptide for the FA assay. 

14-3-3σ, tagged with a Twinstrep-tag, was immobilized on a Strep-Tactin XT coated SPR chip. Subsequently, a 2-fold dilution series of acetylated 12-mer C-RAF, A-RAF, and B-RAF peptides were injected. 

14-3-3σ + MG with C-RAF forms a complex -> Immobilized on SPR chip -> C-RAF washed away and C-RAF again added over a concentration range. 

14-3-3 interaction with C-RAF peptides ~ uM range Kd.  14-3-3 + MG interaction with C-RAF peptides ~ nM range Kd (kon increases with MG, koff decreases with MG)

Cellular assays: 
1. NanoBRET between C-RAF (N-luc tagged) and 14-3-3Sigma (Halo tagged), between N-RAS and C-RAF, C-RAF/C-RAF dimerization nano-BRET
2. co-IP in HEK293T cells: N-RAS (GTP bound form) - RAF (FLAG tagged) - 14-3-3 (HA tagged) => co IP with anti-FLAG beads
3. Lumit antibody assay for pERK activation
4. nanoBRET for 14-3-3sigma - A RAF/14-3-3sigma - B RAF as well as A-RAF/B-RAF/C-RAF homo and heterodimers
